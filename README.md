# JavaScript Null and 0 Loose Comparison

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) of null and 0 values.  In JavaScript, `null == 0` evaluates to `false`, but this can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly, especially in functions that might receive null or undefined parameters.

The `bug.js` file contains a function that illustrates the problem and the potential for unexpected results. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to explicitly handle null values to prevent errors.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, browser console).
3. Observe the output and the unexpected result when null values are passed to the function.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for null values before performing any operations that might be affected by them.
